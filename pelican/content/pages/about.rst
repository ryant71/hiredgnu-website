This Blog
---------

Written in reStructured Text for the Pelican blogging software. Why Pelican and
reStructured Text? I'll start with the reStructured Text choice: I like using
a normal text editor - now NEOVIM. I'm also using RST at work 
so I wanted to get to know it well. Pelican is actually more or a build system
than a true blogging platform - why use it? I've used WordPress before and didn't
want the headache of keeping ahead of the copious security flaws that inevitably 
creep into anything created in PHP. (That **one** time I didn't patch Wordpress 
quick enough my whole blog got totally b0rked. Never again.)

Currently, this blog is hosted on S3 with Cloudfront proving the caching.
