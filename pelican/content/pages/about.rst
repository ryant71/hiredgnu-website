This Blog
---------

Written in reStructured Text for the Pelican blogging software. Why Pelican and
reStructured Text? I'll start with the reStructured Text choice: I like using
a normal text editor - either VIM or Sublime Text. I'm also using RST at work 
so I wanted to get to know it well. Pelican is actually more or a build system
than a true blogging platform - why use it? I've used WordPress before and didn't
want the headache of keeping ahead of the copious security flaws that inevitably 
creep into anything created in PHP. (That **one** time I didn't patch Wordpress 
quick enough my whole blog got totally b0rked. Never again.)

I like writing blog posts with a standard text editor, saving my changes to 
mercurial/bitbucket and then, when I'm ready to publish, type ``make rsync_upload``
and having my posts uploaded over ``ssh`` to my web server.
